# OVERVIEW
This repository contains jupyter notebook and data for exploring an air quality dataset. The dataset includes information about various air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, as well as temperature, pressure, rain, wind direction, and wind speed.
## VARIABLE:
SO2: Sulfur dioxide concentration
NO2: Nitrogen dioxide concentration
CO: Carbon monoxide concentration
O3: Ozone concentration
Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure
Rain: Rainfall amount
Wind Direction: Direction of wind
Wind Speed: Speed of wind

## ANALYSIS TASK:
Data Gathering: Gather and load the dataset into Python environment.
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships among different variables.
Plotting (Visualization): Create visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and time series plots to explore the data.
Summary: Calculate summary statistics for different pollutants and meteorological parameters.
